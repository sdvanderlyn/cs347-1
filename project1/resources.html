                <p>As I said earlier, I'm not the greatest pixel artist out there. There are many other great resources out there to help you learn and draw better pixel art. Here are some of my favorites.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterMilko" target="_blank">Pixel Pete</a></p>
                <p>Pixel Pete is an awesome pixel artist with great tutorials. He is also a game developer and makes tutorials that are very easy to follow. He has a lot of examples of basic objects like walls, trees, bushes, houses, and many more. He also goes various techniques for pixel art like shading, coloring, and perspective.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BJGpixel" target="_blank">Brandon James Greer</a></p>
                <p>BJG creates whole scenes out of pixels and does an amazing job animating them to feel alive. He's good to watch if you want to learn some kind of work flow when you are creating pixel art. He also does an analysis on pixel art from various games and provides great insight.</p>
                <p><a href="https://lospec.com/" target="_blank">lospec</a></p>
                <p>Lospec is a great site to find other pixel artists and get inspired. They have tutorials as well and are a great resource if you prefer to read rather than watch videos. If you are bad at picking colors, lospec has a community of users that provide a color palette that you can use for your art. These palettes could also be useful for designing websites as well.</p>
