                <h2>What is a pixel?</h2>
                <p>A pixel is just a square on the screen. Everything on this
                website and on your screen is made of pixels. These small squares
                that make up the images and text on your screen are called
                pixels.</p>

                <h2>Okay, so what is pixel art?</h2>
                <p>Pixel art is using pixels to make stuff. But wait, everything is
                already made of pixels on your screen, so what's the difference? The
                difference between the pixels on your screen and pixel art is that
                pixel art usually has a limited set of colors along with pixels
                having been placed with intention rather than automatically
                generated. The art also has a small resolution that may be scaled
                up. The artstyle comes from the limitations from an early
                computing era where memory was limited and only a certain amount of
                colors could be displayed at a small resolution.<p>

                <p>A classic game, Super Mario Bros. was created on the Nintendo
                Entertainment System which had a limited color palette.</p>
