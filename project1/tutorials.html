                    <h2>What is a pixel?</h2>
                    <p>A pixel is just a square on the screen. Everything on this
                    website and on your screen is made of pixels. These small squares
                    that make up the images and text on your screen are called
                    pixels.</p>

                    <h2>Okay, so what is pixel art?</h2>
                    <p>Pixel art is using pixels to make stuff. But wait, everything is
                    already made of pixels on your screen, so what's the difference? The
                    difference between the pixels on your screen and pixel art is that
                    pixel art usually has a limited set of colors along with pixels
                    having been placed with intention rather than automatically
                    generated. The art also has a small resolution that may be scaled
                    up. The artstyle comes from the limitations from an early
                    computing era where memory was limited and only a certain amount of
                    colors could be displayed at a small resolution.<p>

                    <p>A classic game, Super Mario Bros. was created on the Nintendo
                    Entertainment System which had a limited color palette.</p>

                    <h2>Canvas Size</h2>
                    <p>A question that beginners ask a lot is what canvas size should they use. To use a canvas size for that mimics the NES, you would use 256x240. The SNES, surprisingly, has around the same resolution (a bit less actually!). For slightly higher resolution games that still have a pixel art feel, you'll want a canvas size similar to the Sega Genesis of 320x224. I personally use a 9:16 resolution that closely mimics the SNES which is 384x216.</p>

                    <h2>Color Theory</h2>
                    <p>If you're still scratching your head on how the SNES has a smaller resolution than the NES but still manage to look better, then learning color is important. The SNES had a much wider color range and was less limited. This allowed for more colors and better lighting which gave sprite a lot more detail. Realize that less shading leads to a more cartoonish look, not resolution!</p>

                    <h2>Perspective</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to drawing art, perspective is very important. In pixel art, this is no different and can really show your art style. There are 3 common perspectives you'll see in pixel art:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Side (Super Mario Bros.)</li>
                        <li>Top-down (Legend of Zelda)</li>
                        <li>Isometric (Age of Empires)</li>
                    </ol>
