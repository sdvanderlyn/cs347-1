                    <h2>What is a pixel?</h2>
                    <p>A pixel is just a square on the screen. Everything on this
                    website and on your screen is made of pixels. These small squares
                    that make up the images and text on your screen are called
                    pixels.</p>

                    <h2>Okay, so what is pixel art?</h2>
                    <p>Pixel art is using pixels to make stuff. But wait, everything is
                    already made of pixels on your screen, so what's the difference? The
                    difference between the pixels on your screen and pixel art is that
                    pixel art usually has a limited set of colors along with pixels
                    having been placed with intention rather than automatically
                    generated. The art also has a small resolution that may be scaled
                    up. The artstyle comes from the limitations from an early
                    computing era where memory was limited and only a certain amount of
                    colors could be displayed at a small resolution.<p>

                    <p>A classic game, Super Mario Bros. was created on the Nintendo
                    Entertainment System which had a limited color palette.</p>
