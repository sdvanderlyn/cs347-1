                    <h2>What is a pixel?</h2>
                    <p>A pixel is just a square on the screen. Everything on this
                    website and on your screen is made of pixels. These small squares
                    that make up the images and text on your screen are called
                    pixels.</p>

                    <h2>Okay, so what is pixel art?</h2>
                    <p>Pixel art is using pixels to make stuff. But wait, everything is already made of pixels on your screen, so what's the difference? The difference between the pixels on your screen and pixel art is that pixel art usually has a limited set of colors along with pixels having been placed with intention rather than automatically generated. The art also has a small resolution that may be scaled up. The artstyle comes from the limitations from an early computing era where memory was limited and only a certain amount of colors could be displayed at a small resolution.<p>
                    <p>A classic game, Super Mario Bros. was created on the Nintendo Entertainment System which had a limited color palette. This meant that the game's graphics had to be smart with their colors. These days we have 3d games with extremely high quality graphics. Pixel art is an aesthetic that people enjoy looking at. It is also a great way for indie game devs to create objects for their games without spending a lot of time on art or 3d modeling.</p>

                    <h2>Canvas Size</h2>
                    <p>A question that beginners ask a lot is what canvas size should they use. To use a canvas size for that mimics the NES, you would use 256x240. The SNES, surprisingly, has around the same resolution (a bit less actually!). For slightly higher resolution games that still have a pixel art feel, you'll want a canvas size similar to the Sega Genesis of 320x224. I personally use a 9:16 resolution which is 384x216.</p>
                    <p>For the actual sprite objects themselves, I suggest starting small at around 8x8 or 16x16 pixels. It may be difficult fit everything you want, but it's very important that you are able to learn how to abstract things down to a pixel. For example, eyes will have to be one pixel, a smile may only be 4 or 5 pixels. You have to be creative to make good pixel art.As always, practice makes perfect!</p>

                    <h2>Color Theory</h2>
                    <p>If you're still scratching your head on how the SNES has a smaller resolution than the NES but still manage to look better, then learning color is important. The SNES had a much wider color range and was less limited. This allowed for more colors and better lighting which gave sprite a lot more detail. Realize that less shading leads to a more cartoonish look, not resolution!</p>

                    <h2>Perspective</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to drawing art, perspective is very important. In pixel art, this is no different and can really show your art style. There are 3 common perspectives you'll see in pixel art:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Side (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros." target="_blank">Super Mario Bros.</a>)</li>
                        <li>Top-down (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)" target="_blank">Legend of Zelda</a>)</li>
                        <li>Isometric (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_(video_game)" target="_blank">Age of Empires</a>)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img src="images/perspective.png" alt="Examples of side, top-down, and isometric perspectives in pixel art using a box" /> 
                    <p>Note that by simply making the color lighter on top in box 2, you can create that top down perspective which makes it look like light is coming from the sky or ceiling.</p>
