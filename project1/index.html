                <p>Hello artists. I want to show you how to make some pixel art. I have been making pixel art because I am a fan of the classic video games that were pixelated and limited in color due to hardware limitations. As a game developer, I need a way to create graphics my code can interact with. For me personally, 3d modeling is not as fun. Pixel art is a lot cooler to me and it can be much easier as well if you start small. If you are interested in making pixel art for your games or just as a fun hobby, then look no further!</p>
