1. I like the cleanliness of the site. Everything is well put together and in a nice format. I also like the easy navigational
ability of buttons that arent included in the nav bar but still help swith pages.

2. I feel like your site is the complete opposite of mine apearrance wise. I took a more colorfull aproach, while yours is more 
dull with the blackish-gray background and white text. I do like it, but over time scrolling through all the text did make looking 
at the site a strain on my eyes. 

3. Code is well indented and everything looks easy to follow. I couldnt view the thing under the fonts file but I beleive in should be fine 
after seeing how well th rest of the folders are.

4a. I noticed when changing window size everything is good, but the perspective images where you show the different games doesnt update also.
4b. Content wise just adding some commas or editing the text a little bit shold clean those up.

5a. One thought I'd propose is adding something in the left and right margin of most pages (maybe a pixel art type thing)
along the text so that space is used instead of being left untouched.
5b.
